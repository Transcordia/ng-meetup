## AngularJS October Meetup on Forms

This project is built on the yo-angular template.  I substituted out the angular routing for ui-router support.  

This project uses node and grunt. To run the built-in web server, first install the following:

* **Install node**: [install here](http://http://nodejs.org/).
* **Install Bower**: Install bower by running "npm install -g bower"
* **Run npm install**: Go to the root directory of the project and run "npm install"  
* **Use bower to install javascript libraries**: Go to the root directory and run "bower install"
* **Launch webserver**: Go to the root directory and run "grunt serve"
